brew-install
=====================================

The brew-install project is used to create a brew formula for installing
clojure tools on the Mac. The outputs of this project are a tar file
(versioned) and a brew formula (clojure.rb), suitable for updating in the 
brew central tap.

The tar file contains:

* clojure-tools jar - an uberjar for constructing classpaths via tools.deps
* deps.edn - the initial user deps.edn file
* clojure script - the main Clojure runner
* clj script - a clojure wrapper for interactive repl use (adds rlwrap)

## Updating versions

The clojure-tools version is defined by the pom.xml project version. It 
should be updated only by running script/build/update_version (the build does
this automatically).

The Clojure and tools.deps.alpha versions to include in the clojure-tools are
defined in the pom.xml as properties and make their way from there into all the
other files via several means.

## Package script

The script/package.sh script is used to build the tar file and clojure.rb file.

## Release Information

These files are not released into Maven central like other libraries. Instead, the tar
file is created and published to https://download.clojure.org.

The clojure.rb file is then manually updated in the brew central tap via PR.
